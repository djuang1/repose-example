# Repose and MuleSoft
 
This example project shows how to deploy a Mule application with an embedded reverse proxy called Repose. [Repose](http://www.openrepose.org/) is a pseudo-transparent reverse proxy. It includes an list of extensible [filters](http://www.openrepose.org/versions/latest/filters/index.html) that can be applied to requests ranging from authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. 

Instead of re-writing these filters in Mule, you can run Repose side-by-side. MuleSoft provides an iPaaS infrastructure that allows you to rapidly deploy and scale this solution quickly and easily over your existing services and endpoints.
